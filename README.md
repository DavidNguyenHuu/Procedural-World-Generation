# Procedural World Generation

A graphics program using OpenGL for walking through a procedurally created virtual world. The terrain was generated using a heightmap with the help of the "Perlin Noise" algorithm. Simple interaction mechanisms were also added to navigate through the world and view it from different angles by toggling multiple camera view matrices.
